jTriad contact form allows you to create a triads: first value + second value + email (eg: City + Vacancy + email). Two variables are displayed as the two dropdown list, that allows you to create any number of addresses to send messages from the site, depending on the selected values.

The module checks the correspondence between the first and second value, showing a warning; also implemented validation of filling out forms. You can edit text alerts in the files in /assets/formValidator/jquery.validationEngine.js and helper.php, an administrative panel of the module currently does not offer this possibility.

Attention, this module requires the inclusion Recaptcha-plugin!
